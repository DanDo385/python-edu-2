# Project 42: Complete Transformer Implementation

## Learning Objectives

- Build a complete transformer model from scratch
- Combine encoder and decoder stacks
- Implement full transformer for sequence-to-sequence tasks
- Understand how all components work together
- Foundation for building LLMs

## Problem Description

This project combines all transformer components into a complete model. You'll build a full encoder-decoder transformer.

## Key Concepts

- Encoder stack with multiple transformer blocks
- Decoder stack with masked attention
- Cross-attention between encoder and decoder
- Complete transformer architecture

## Deliverables

Complete transformer implementation with encoder, decoder, and full model.

## Testing

Run: `pytest test.py -v`
