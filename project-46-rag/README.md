# Project 46: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Learning Objectives

- Understand RAG architecture
- Implement document retrieval
- Combine retrieval with generation
- Build RAG system for question answering
- Understand how RAG improves LLM responses

## Problem Description

RAG combines retrieval (finding relevant documents) with generation (LLM producing answers) to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations.

## Key Concepts

- Document embedding and retrieval
- Context injection into prompts
- RAG pipeline
- Improving LLM responses with external knowledge

## Deliverables

Basic RAG implementation with retrieval and generation components.

## Testing

Run: `pytest test.py -v`
