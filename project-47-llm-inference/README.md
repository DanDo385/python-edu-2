# Project 47: LLM Inference and Optimization

## Learning Objectives

- Understand LLM inference challenges
- Implement KV caching for efficiency
- Understand quantization techniques
- Optimize inference speed
- Handle batch inference

## Problem Description

LLM inference requires optimization for speed and memory. KV caching, quantization, and batching improve performance.

## Key Concepts

- KV caching (reuse computed keys/values)
- Quantization (reduce precision)
- Batch processing
- Inference optimization

## Deliverables

Optimized inference implementation with KV caching.

## Testing

Run: `pytest test.py -v`
