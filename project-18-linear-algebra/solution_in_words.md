# Solution in Words: Linear Algebra Essentials for ML

## How to Think About This Problem

### Understanding Vectors

Think of a vector as a list of numbers that represents a point in space, or a set of features.

**Mental Model:**
```
Vector [3, 4] = point 3 units right, 4 units up
In ML: [age, income, height] = one person's features
```

### Understanding Dot Products

**What we're doing:** Multiplying corresponding elements and summing.

**How to think about it:**
- Measures how "aligned" two vectors are
- If vectors point same direction → large dot product
- If perpendicular → dot product = 0
- In ML: computes weighted sums (features × weights)

**Example thought process:**
- Vector a: [1, 2, 3]
- Vector b: [4, 5, 6]
- Dot product: 1×4 + 2×5 + 3×6 = 4 + 10 + 18 = 32
- This is how neural networks compute: input features × weights

### Understanding Matrix-Vector Multiplication

**What we're doing:** Transforming a vector using a matrix.

**How to think about it:**
- Each row of matrix is a set of weights
- Multiply row by input vector → get one output
- All rows → all outputs
- This IS how neural network layers work!

**Example thought process:**
- Input: [x1, x2, x3] (3 features)
- Weights: [[w11, w12], [w21, w22], [w31, w32]] (3×2 matrix)
- Output: [y1, y2] where:
  - y1 = x1×w11 + x2×w21 + x3×w31
  - y2 = x1×w12 + x2×w22 + x3×w32
- This is exactly what happens in a neural network layer!

### Understanding Linear Systems

**What we're doing:** Finding x such that Ax = b.

**How to think about it:**
- A is a matrix of coefficients
- b is a vector of results
- x is what we're solving for
- In ML: finding optimal weights that minimize error

### Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Visualize shapes**: Draw the vectors/matrices
2. **Understand the operation**: What are we computing?
3. **Think element-wise**: How does each output element relate to inputs?
4. **Connect to ML**: How does this relate to neural networks?

### Key Insight

Every neural network operation is linear algebra:
- Forward pass: matrix multiplication
- Backward pass: matrix multiplication (transposed)
- Loss computation: vector operations
- Optimization: linear algebra

Understanding linear algebra = understanding how neural networks work!
