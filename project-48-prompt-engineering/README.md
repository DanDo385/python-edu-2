# Project 48: Prompt Engineering

## Learning Objectives

- Understand prompt engineering techniques
- Implement few-shot prompting
- Chain-of-thought prompting
- Prompt templates
- Optimize prompts for better results

## Problem Description

Prompt engineering is crucial for getting good results from LLMs. Different techniques (few-shot, chain-of-thought) improve performance.

## Key Concepts

- Few-shot prompting (examples in prompt)
- Chain-of-thought (step-by-step reasoning)
- Prompt templates
- Prompt optimization

## Deliverables

Prompt engineering utilities and templates.

## Testing

Run: `pytest test.py -v`
