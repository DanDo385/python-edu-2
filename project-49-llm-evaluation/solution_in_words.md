# Solution Explanation: LLM Evaluation

## Overview

BLEU measures precision of n-grams, perplexity measures language modeling quality.

## Key Points

- BLEU: Precision-based metric for translation/generation
- Perplexity: Measures how well model predicts next token
- Lower perplexity = better language model
- Different metrics for different tasks
