# Project 44: Fine-tuning Large Language Models

## Learning Objectives

- Understand fine-tuning strategies for LLMs
- Implement LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- Fine-tune pretrained models for specific tasks
- Understand parameter-efficient fine-tuning
- Adapt LLMs for downstream tasks

## Problem Description

Fine-tuning adapts pretrained LLMs for specific tasks. LoRA and other techniques make this parameter-efficient.

## Key Concepts

- Full fine-tuning vs parameter-efficient
- LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- Task-specific adaptation
- Transfer learning for LLMs

## Deliverables

LoRA implementation and fine-tuning pipeline for LLMs.

## Testing

Run: `pytest test.py -v`
