# Solution Explanation: Transformer Architecture

## Overview

Transformers use attention mechanisms instead of RNNs, enabling parallel processing and better long-range dependencies.

## Key Concepts

### Positional Encoding

- Adds position information to embeddings
- Uses sine/cosine functions
- Enables understanding of sequence order

### Transformer Block

- Self-attention layer
- Feed-forward network
- Residual connections
- Layer normalization

This architecture is the foundation for GPT, BERT, and all modern LLMs!
